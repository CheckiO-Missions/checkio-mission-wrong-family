        The problem is that you need to gradually check the family tree (which consists of lists of family connections)
        for various false combinations. For example, such as: a son became the father of his father, a brother became
        the father of his brother, an outsider appeared in the family (an outsider is when his name does not appear in
        the lists of family ties to him), one son has several parents , different parents have one son, etc.

        We will use the for loop and if conditions for our solution. Let's create a loop in which we will
        check such false connections as: the son has more than one father, the son became the father of his father.
        Let's add two variables, and the code will be as follows:
        <pre class="brush: python">
dads = []
sons = []
for dad, son in tree:  # We iterate through this list
    dads += [dad]  # We add the first father to the dads variable
    if son in sons:  # We check that there is no such son in the sons variable
        return False  # If there was, we return False
    sons += [son]  # If it wasn't, then we add the son to the list of sons
    if [son, dad] in tree:  # We check whether the son has become the father of his father
        return False  # If so, then we return False
        </pre>
    </div>

        Let's add another check for the fact that someone else has appeared in the family. Let's use the new
        variable fatherless and write our check with a for loop. The code will be as follows:
        <pre class="brush: python">
fatherless = 0
for dad in set(dads):  # We iterate through the list of parents
            # with set() we reduced the repetition of the father's name
    if dad not in sons:  # Every time as a father in the list of sons
        fatherless += 1  # we add 1 to the variable
        if fatherless > 1:  # Since we have the first father who started a family
            return False  # then we do not take him into account, but if another father appears
            # which starts a new family, then we return False
        </pre>

        You have a few things left. It wraps the code in a function expression, and returns
        True if all checks pass and the family tree is indeed correct.
        <pre class="brush: python">
def is_family(tree: list[list[str]]) -> bool:
    dads = []
    sons = []

    for dad, son in tree:
        dads += [dad]
        if son in sons:
            return False
        sons += [son]
        if [son, dad] in tree:
            return False

    fatherless = 0
    for dad in set(dads):
        if dad not in sons:
            fatherless += 1
            if fatherless > 1:

        This decision will be difficult to understand. A module <a href='https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/collections.html?highlight=collections#module-collections'>"collections"</a>
        is used here.
        The defaultdict dictionaries from this module can emulate different data types, in this case it is set.
        So using the properties of sets, we can check all false relationships in the family tree in a single for loop.
        <pre class="brush: python">
from collections import defaultdict

def is_family(tree):
    anscestor = defaultdict(set)
    for father, son in tree:
        if father == son: return False
        if father in anscestor[son]: return False
        if son in anscestor[father]: return False
        if anscestor[father] & anscestor[son]: return False
        anscestor[son] |= {father} | anscestor[father]
    adam = [person for person in anscestor if not anscestor[person]]
    return len(adam) == 1
        </pre>
    </div>
